       <p>The Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) is an engineering 
        entrance assessment conducted for admission to various 
        engineering colleges in India. It is constituted by two
         different examinations: the JEE-Main and the JEE-Advanced.</p>
         <p>
            The Joint Seat Allocation Authority (JoSAA) conducts
             the joint admission process for a total of 23 Indian
              Institutes of Technology (IITs), 31 National Institutes 
              of Technology (NITs), 25 Indian Institutes of Information
               Technology (IIITs) campuses and other Government Funded 
               Technical Institutes (GFTIs) based on the rank obtained 
               by a student in JEE-Main or JEE-Advanced, depending on 
               the engineering college.
         </p>
         <br>
         <p>
            There are some institutes, such as the Indian 
            Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISERs),
             the Indian Institute of Petroleum and Energy (IIPE),
              the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Petroleum Technology
               (RGIPT), the Indian Institute of Space Science and
                Technology (IIST), and the Indian Institute of
                 Science (IISc), which use the score obtained in
                  the JEE-Advanced examination as the basis for 
                  admission,[2][3] but are not a part of the Joint
                   Seat Allocation Authority (JoSAA) counselling 
                   process. Any student who takes admission to an
                    Indian Institute of Technology cannot appear 
                    for the JEE-Advanced examination again, but 
                    the same is not the case with NIT, IISc, IISERs,
                     RGIPT, IIPE, and IIST.

         <h2>JEE Main</h2>
         <p>
            JEE-Main is conducted by National Testing Agency 
            (NTA). JEE-Main has two papers, Paper-I and Paper-II.
             Candidates may opt for either or both of them. 
             Both papers contain multiple choice questions. 
             Paper-I is for admission to B.E./B.Tech courses 
             and is conducted in a Computer Based Test mode. 
             Paper-II is for admission in B.Arch and B.Planning 
             courses and will also be conducted in Computer Based 
             Test mode except for one paper, namely the 'Drawing 
             Test' which shall be conducted in Pen and Paper mode 
             or offline mode. From January 2020 onwards, 
             an additional Paper-III is being introduced for 
             B.Planning courses separately.
